										<h1>Our Story</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/website-pics/blob/main/history.jpeg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
									<b>The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians self-organized in order to make better decisions about the Ethereum protocol, smart
									contract standards, and issues in the community.</b>
									<p>Our story begins with <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-615.md">EIP-615</a>. In Fall, 2017, <a href="https://github.com/gcolvin">Greg Colvin</a> did not understand why EVM-related upgrade work he had been
									developing at the Ethereum Foundation was not being considered for inclusion in the protocol, and why an open process
									did not exist for deciding on the issue. While the core devs calls were seen as helpful and crucial for protocol
									updates, the prevalent use of chat rooms and GitHub comments prevented meaningful discussions outside of the calls.</p>
									<p>On discussing the situation with <a href="https://twitter.com/jemenger">Jamie Pitts</a> at <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/11/16/devcon3/">Devcon3</a> in Cancun, we decided to work on ways to address the problem of
									communications and decision-making in the community. This culminated in the creation of an <a href="https://medium.com/@jpitts/an-open-invitation-to-participate-in-a-fellowship-of-ethereum-magicians-982e6143db4f">Open Invitation to Participate</a>
									, which outlined the principles and practices for a proposed open “dis-organization” of Ethereum developers
									in the community. The emerging group decided to call ourselves “Magicians" in keeping with the humor widely used in the
									community, and also acknowledging that technology is a kind of magic.</p>
									<p>The first gathering of the Magicians was held in March, 2018 at EthCC in Paris. In the hallowed halls of the
									Conservatoire Nationale des Arts et Métiers, a large number of people from the community came together and formed a very
									large circle... to discuss “governance”. But the discussion was not dominated by vague, philosophical musings! In our
									circle, we talked about how we currently govern the protocol, how we communicate about the technical issues, and how we
									could improve that process.</p>
									<p>Thus began our path to holding regular gatherings, hosting discussions, and helping the community organize its work!</p>
									<p>The original group of participants was joined by many more leaders who then began to form “Rings”, which are working
									groups to focus on different aspects of the protocol, smart contract standards, and community issues.
									The Rings are documented on the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki">Wiki</a>, and all are welcome to start one! Although we don't use term "Rings" much lately on our forum, the groups organically started to use term "Groups" instead.</p>
									<p>A key Ring which formed in 2018 was the Operations Ring. This group has organized numerous events, and generally manages
									the various assets and technical resources for the community, including the Magicians’ Forum. The Magicians do not have
									a central authority, rather people in the community are encouraged to self-organize into Rings, lead, support each
									other, and get work done! Leaders in the Operations Ring have recently included <a href="https://twitter.com/bmann">Boris Mann</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/MPtherealMVP">María Paula</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomislavmamic">Tomislav Mamic</a>,
									and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnettRolikova">Anett Rolikova</a>.</p>
									<p>The Operations Ring continues to organize events and support community discussions. We are here for you, so please reach
									out to us on the forum if you would like some help with organizing your work. Lately the active supporters of Operations Ring (team) has been <a href="https://twitter.com/AnettRolikova">Anett Rolikova</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jemenger">Jamie Pitts</a>, don't hesitate to reach out to them in any case of support.</p>
